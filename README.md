## 👋 Hi, I'm Judy!

### 🎓 Junior at the University of Utah, studying Computer Engineering
### 🔭 Aspiring Hardware, Software, Machine Learning, and Business Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I’m committed to continuous learning and skill development, and I believe taking initiative is crucial to personal growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow!](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data analysis. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals - got any leads? Let me know!


### 🎯 Featured Project: [Stock Price Prediction from Financial News](https://github.com/248JO/Break-Through-Tech-Salesforce-1a)
What We Did: This project, Stock Price Prediction from Financial News, created a machine learning pipeline to forecast short-term S&P 500 price movements. We utilized FinBERT for sentiment analysis on news headlines, integrated these sentiment features with historical stock data, and trained models, such as XGBoost, to predict the next-day trend.

Tools: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn

Results: The XGBoost model demonstrated a theoretical 165.67% return in a simulated trading period, with insights showing that news sentiment had a weak incremental impact on accuracy, guiding a revised feature engineering strategy.
